## Step 1: Generating Changesets

## Step 2: Converting Changesets to Tagsets (tagset_gen.py)
Once you have your directories of testing and training changesets, the next step is to generate respective "tagset" directories for both of them. Tagsets, generated by a module called Columbus, are the objects that will be used to test and train the machine learning algorithm Vowpal Wabbit. Instead of containing filepaths for every file added or modified during a program download like changesets do, tagsets hold a tokenized list of all of the directory and file names that each filepath consists of. To generate a directory of tagsets for a given directory of changesets, run the following command:

` ./tagset_gen.py [changeset_directory_name] [tagset_directory_name]`

Note that you can use absolute or relative paths for this command. In addition, the `tagset_directory_name` argument is optional. If it is not provided, a tagset directory will be created in the working directory (named `tagesets-x`). 

You will have to run this module twice: once for your training changeset directory and one for your testing changeset directory.

## Step 3: Train a Model and Test it! (main.py and hybrid.py)
